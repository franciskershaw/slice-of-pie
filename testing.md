# Testing

Click [here](README.md) to return to the main project documentation.

Testing of this project was carried out through the following methods:

* Constant review during development using Gitpod's browser previewers and Chrome developer tools.
* User testing of the deployed site when close to completion.
* Manual user story testing during and after the writing of the code.
* Automated testing of the HTML and CSS files using the WC3 validators.
* Automated testing of the JavaScript and Python files using JSHINT and PEP8 Online respectively.
* Automated testing of the site's accessibility using the WAVE accessibility tool.
* Automated testing of the site's general performance through Google's lighthouse feature.

As per my previous project, I attempted to stick to agile principles by using Trello to make sure that the project was first built to its most simple iteration - breaking large sections of the code to be written into sprints, with those sprints further broken up into individual tasks to be completed. Each completed task would then usually be assigned to its own git commit so that I had the option to revert to working versions of the code if my site was to break for an unknown reason.

## Testing During Development

### Browser Preview and Chrome Developer Tools

Visuals/Responsiveness

* Testing of the front end visuals was carried out using Gitpod's browser preview in order to make sure that elements and styles were being displayed as intended.
* While on the temporary browser previews, Google Chrome's developer tools were always in use to check the responsiveness of my pages across a number of screen sizes.

Logic

Following on from my previous project, where the application of JavaScript was the main focus, I made sure I kept the same process in place when developing both the JavaScript functions and the Python back end logic for my site - that is to say start small and build up, making sure to check the console and print statements at all stages to ensure that the right results are being reached. Environment variables were also used and included in my .gitignore file to ensure that none of the sensitive secret keys were ever pushed to GitHub.

I started by building the most basic version of the front end, with forms containing only a few fields so that I wasn't wasting time filling out required information for submission each time I needed to test my python functions. After taking great care and plenty of time to ensure that all of my CRUD logic was working on the backend, with the adding, editing, deleting of both the festival hubs and the reviews all doing what I was expecting to the relevant MongoDB collections, did I feel more comfortable moving onto the next stage of development.

For my JavaScript, I wanted a way to make sure that only certain functions were being applied to certain pages as this would greatly help with the code formatting as it would negate the need for me to create several specific JavaScript functions. To achieve this, I wrote a function that checked which page the user was on, and an *if/else* statement then applied only the relevant functions to the relevant pages.

There were inevitably several interesting bugs that needed attention, for more information please see the 'notable' bugs section below.

### Post Deployment

As this project depended almost entirely on the ability of external users being able to interact with the site through creating, reading, updating and deleting content from a common dataset, it was especially important on this project that the user testing I instigated was thorough. With that in mind, I sent the live version of the website to 15 people with the following directives, leaving out specific instructions of *how* to achieve what the site could do to check that it was intuitive enough:

1. Create an account, log out and sign back in.
2. Browse the available festivals for information and add some to favourites.
3. Remove some festivals from your favourites.
4. Add a few reviews to different festival hubs, edit one of them, and delete one.
5. Provide me with general feedback and let me know what device and browser was being used.

This defined structure for user testing helped me focus my testers to test the integral parts of the site and answer the following questions:

1. Is my site intuitive enough to use very quickly?
2. Do all of my backend functions work outside of my own development environment and tools?
3. Is there any extra information I should be adding to my FAQ page?
4. Is there anything at all not working as it should do?

One key issue highlighted that I considered a UX issue as opposed to a code bug was the lack of information given on the sign up page as to what was allowed when choosing a username and password, as I had included a restriction to alphanumeric characters. This was amended by including small print underneath the username and password fields to clear up any confusion.

Overall though, I felt that questions 1-2 were answered with a yes as the general feedback was positive with regard to the ease of use on the site - and all of my backend functions were working exactly as I needed them to. I also didn't think I needed to add any further information to the FAQ page as there were no questions asked to me as to how the site needed to be used.

There were however a few bugs and general UX issues brought to my attention, which I will detail below.

### Notable bugs

This being my very first full stack website, there were inevitably plenty of bugs to sink my teeth into throughout development of this project, found during the building of the site and from user testing:

#### Fixed

*Commented out jinja templating code*

My browse page was throwing an exception error without me having the faintest idea why, as I didn't see the problem being highlighted appearing anywhere on my code. It was only after a great deal of time that I was reminded that jinja templating does not ignore commented out code, and some code I had commented out earlier to bring back later was actually causing everything to break. A frustratingly simple fix that I am now very unlikely to forget about!

*Updating festivals*

Initially when updating anything to do with the festival hubs, all of the reviews were being removed. This was because my edit function was inputting an empty array (the same as when adding a festival to begin with) instead of just leaving the reviews as they were. **This was fixed easily by removing the empty array from the edit_festival function.**

Later on, I also found issues when updating the name of the festival as the updating of the URL was causing a 500 error. Initially my fix was to simply have the edit function not change the URL, but eventually I worked out that a more satisfactory fix was to **create a new_url variable at the beginning of the function, which would then be inputted to MongoDB and then used to reload the page.**

*JS function to assign certain pages as 'true' not working at various points*

As mentioned above, I wrote a function that would assign 'true' to whichever page the user was currently browsing. This appeared to be working fine, but then all of a sudden was not working as intended. After checking the developer tools, I realised that my method of assigning 'true' by locating the first section of the page (which included the name of the page as a class) was being broken by the appearance of flash messages when certain user actions were taking place. **This was fixed quite easily by changing the flash messages *section* element to a *div*.**

*Appear animation on festival hubs blocking defensive design features*

It was clear from testing that there were occasionally quite noticeable loading times for the hero images on the festival hubs. These images were pulled straight from google images via their URL, so I was unable to optimise them properly as I would do via direct upload - but I figured using the same kind of delayed entry animation as on my previous projects would help mask this. However once this was applied to the template, the bootstrap modals for deleting of reviews suddenly was not working properly as it trapped users in place on a modal that wouldn't let you quit or even proceed with deleting. This was obviously not acceptable, and I never quite worked out why this was happening within the timeframe I had available before project submission, however the fix was made **by opting to allow the minor UX issue in lieu of including the appear animation on the hubs.**

*500 error when favouriting a search result*

Very late in development I came across a tricky bug regarding the combination of searching and favouriting festival hubs. I noticed that if a user tried to favourite a festival directly after using the search bar, a 500 error was initiated. This was because my favouriting function was attempting to reload the page, which had since lost the initial query.

My first attempt to fix involved directing the user to their favourites page once they favourited the festival from the search function, as this was the logical route. While this worked for logged in users, those who had not logged in would find a different 500 error coming their way because of the the lack of a session user variable. **In the end, to avoid this being an issue for any user, I redirected any *False* query back to the browse all page.**

*500 error when attempting to access favourites page without being logged in*

During user testing, it was noted that trying to access the favourites page when not logged in (via direct URL) was throwing a 500 error, despite my code suggesting that it would redirect users to the login page. This was not a bad result, as at least they could not force themselves into others accounts via direct link, but I still wanted a more elegant redirect. After trial and error, I realised that the lack of user variable was causing the issue - **so I implemented a further *if* statement to check whether there was a user in session before carrying on with the code.**

*Squashed footer on android mobile (chrome) when creating an account or logging in*

It was brought to my attention that the appearance of a mobile keyboard on Chrome when using certain Android devices was pushing the footer up and squashing the content in a visually displeasing way. I believe this is due to my use of minimum *vh* as a property, with the keyboard decreasing the viewport height when it appeared. **To fix this, I used a media query that hid the footer entirely when between two small screen height sizes.**

#### Outstanding bugs

There were a few bugs and general UX comments that time constraints did not allow me to work on before submission. However, I am very much keen to return to this project later with a version 2 that will put all of these as top priority and will be fixed before any new features are worked on.

*Form dropdown information not being fetched when editing reviews or festivals on Safari*

This bug came out of user testing, as several of my testers are IOS users while I was primarily using Chrome and Android during development. Editing reviews, the form of which is composed mostly of dropdown menus, was not remembering the information for any dropdown information. It turns out this was because of a fix made after the HTML validator flagged an error regarding my lack of use of a default *option* element on these forms. Once I included this default option, Safari automatically would just choose this default option instead of selecting the previously submitted information - even when hiding the option using CSS. Research online showed me this was a common issue with the way Safari is set up, and the issue was not appearing on Chrome and Safari.

To ensure full cross browser compatibility on V2, this will be a high priority task in the future. I imagine my solution will involve refocusing my current method to Jinja templating logic as opposed to JavaScript to select the right option.

*Sort function only going from A-Z and highest-lowest on browse page*

As a bonus feature, I opted to include the ability to sort all of the festivals on browse.html by A-Z and highest to lowest rated. I initially did not even consider the idea of sorting in the other direction, however several of my user testers highlighted this as an issue. 

Due to time constraints, and the relative lack of importance of this issue to the successful completion of the project, I elected to leave this UX issue unfixed for version 1. However It will also be a high priority for version 2 of the website.

*Favouriting festivals on browse.html refreshes the page and loses pagination*

Late in development, I amended my favouriting function (called when clicking on the heart icon on various pages) to refresh the page it was on. This was because for much of the development process, this function was just directing users to their favourites page. While the function is definitely more user friendly in this state, there is one minor inconvenience caused by it when regarding the browse page, as the pagination included to only show 10 festivals at a time is lost when refreshing the page.

This bug was inconvenient but by no means site breaking, so I elected to leave it unfixed due to the time constraints imposed by submission. As with the other minor issues, its resolution will be prioritised on V2. I already feel that my solution will be to find a way to have the page not refresh at all when calling the function.

## Manual User Story Testing

Testing my own user stories was carried out using the following criteria:

* The user journey must be intuitive.
* (Where applicable) the user must reach their end destination within three clicks.

### ***1. I want to be able to create a profile quickly and intuitively so that I can get started using the website.***

* The moment you arrive on the homepage, a *call to action* button appears in red to draw the user's attention straight away which says 'create account'. **2 clicks.**

![Create account](static/images/create-account.png)

* If the user misses this *call to action* and instead navigates to the 'sign in' button on the main navbar, they are directed to the sign in page, which also has a handy link to the registration page for those who do not have an account yet. **3 clicks.**

![Login](static/images/login.png)


### ***2. As a returning user with a profile, I want to be able to sign in quickly so that I can resume my previous activities and have the option to sign out at the end of a session once I am finished.***

* In terms of returning to the site, if the cache has not been cleared and the user never signed out to begin with then the user remains signed in automatically. Navigation to the homepage will remove the 'create account' button entirely. If the user is not signed in, then simply navigating to the 'sign in' page via the link in the fixed navigation bar will direct them to the sign in form. **0 clicks if cache uncleared and never signed out, 2 clicks if returning for a new session.**

![Navbar signed out](static/images/nav-signed-out.png)

* Once a user is signed in, the navigation bar updates from 'Sign In' to 'Sign Out', and therefore the user is able to sign out from any page they are browsing on the site. **1 click.**

![Navbar](static/images/navbar.png)

### ***3. I want to be able to browse various festival pages so that I can find relevant information/links/reviews and help inform my decision on which festivals to attend.***

* Regardless of whether the user has an account or is a casual browser, the ability to navigate to the all festivals page is available to anyone who ends up on the site. The browse all page is presented via a *call to action* button on the homepage, and is present from the navigation bar at all stages on the user's journey. Once on the browsing page, scrolling and pagination allows the user to browse as little or as many of the festival hubs as possible. **2 clicks when navigating from anywhere on the site to a festival hub, 3-4 if the user decides to 'view more' several times.**

![Browse button](static/images/hover.png)
![Browse page](static/images/browse.png)

### ***4. I would like to be able to sort festivals by various relevant attributes such as A-Z, or highest rated to lowest.***

* When on the browse page, the user can click on the sort icons next to the name or the rating to sort as required. **2 clicks, 1 to get to the browse page from anywhere on the site, 1 to sort.**

![name sort](static/images/name-sort.png)
![rating sort](static/images/rating-sort.png)

### ***5. I want to search for a specific festival page (perhaps because I am already going to be attending) so that I can consume the same information as above.***

The search bar and icon appear in the middle of the navigation bar no matter where you are on the site, and can be used to direct the user to a filtered version of the browse page that shows their results - or no results if the festival doesn't exist on the site. **1 click.**

![search bar](static/images/mobile-nav.png)

### ***6. As a user with a profile, I would like to ‘favourite’ certain festival pages so that I can view all of my favourite festivals in a convenient location.***

* Creating an account or logging in directs the user to the favourites page, to highlight in no uncertain terms that this is an accessible feature for those who are logged in.

![Favourites](static/images/no-favourites.png)

* The buttons to favourite are found in 3 different places on the site, on browse.html where it appears for all users (calling the add_favourites function if the user is logged in or redirect to the registration page if not), on the festival hubs themselves by the *h1* for users who are logged in, and finally on the user's favourites page where they can unfavourite a festival if they wish. **2 clicks from the homepage for logged in users.**

![Browse heart](static/images/heart-browse.png)
![Hub h1](static/images/average-rating.png)
![Favourites heart](static/images/favourites-heart.png)

### ***7. As a user with a profile, I would like to be able to add reviews of the festivals I have been to before so that I can help potential future festival goers make their mind up about where to go.***

* Adding a review is a key reason for the site's existence, and is available as a feature for anyone who is logged into an account. The button for adding a review is found in the reviews section of each festival hub. If the user is logged in, it takes them to the form that needs to be filled in to add a review, if not it redirects to the registration page.

![Add reviews](static/images/add-reviews-section.png)

* While the reviews form is mostly made up of dropdown menus, there is a text box to allow free form opinion writing where a user can give personal thoughts on the festival in question.

![Review text](static/images/review-text.png)

### ***8. As a user who has uploaded a festival review already, I would like to be able to edit that review so that I can add any retrospective comments or change certain of my scores if needs be.***

* All users who are logged in can edit their reviews if they require: by navigating to the review in question, clicking 'Read More', and clicking the edit icon. Once clicked, the user finds themselves back at the same form as before, where they can edit anything they like. **3 clicks from the homepage**

![Edit reviews](static/images/edit-review.png)

### ***9. As a user who has uploaded a review, I want to have the option to delete my review so that I can remove my presence on the site if I want to.***

* As per user story 8, the delete icon for a review can be located by the review's author right next to the edit button. **2 clicks from the festival hub.**

![Collapsed review](static/images/edit-delete-review.png)
![Delete review](static/images/delete-review.png)

### ***11. As a user who can’t find a particular festival on the site, I would like to have a means of requesting that the festival be added.***

* At the bottom of the browsing page, there is a whole *call to action* row with a button directing users to where they can get in touch to ask for a new festival to be added. **2 clicks.**

![Contact us](static/images/contact-us.png)

### ***12. As a user who might not intuitively understand how to use the site, I would like some FAQs that might explain the site’s purpose and intended use so that I can learn how to use the site.***

* At all stages of the user's journey, the FAQ page can be accessed via the fixed navbar. **1 click.**

![Faq screenshot](static/images/faq-screenshot.png)

## Manual Stakeholder Testing

### ***1. I want to produce a site where users can post, edit, browse and delete festival reviews so that I can demonstrate my ability to implement C.R.U.D. functionality and pass this part of the course.***

* Please see user stories 3,4,5,7,8 and 9

### ***2. As the developer, I want the site to function exactly as intended so that only positive emotional responses are produced when interacting with the site.***

* As always I am well aware the the meaning of positive emotional responses can be subjective, however I am confident that through the extensive testing already highlighted that the primary functions needed for this site to be of any use to those who might need it work exactly as I had intended.

### ***3. As the administrator, I would like to be able to add, edit, and delete festival hubs that users can interact with by browsing or adding reviews to.***

* As highlighted in the features and defensive measures section of the [README document](README.md), admin access is available for myself only to add, edit and delete festivals from the site. I can do this by ensuring I'm signed in with the administrator login details, navigating to the browse page, and clicking the 'Add' button. As of the time of writing, there are 27 unique festival hubs for users to interact with and add reviews to, and I intend on inputting more as missing ones are brought to my attention. **3 clicks from homepage.**

![Admin browse](static/images/admin-browse.png)
![Add festival](static/images/add-festival.png)
![Hub hero](static/images/hub-hero-section.png)

### ***4. As a bonus goal, I would like to grow the user base of the site so that the content can improve as more data is added by more and more users.***

* *N/A, this user story is more applicable to version 2 of the site when I can make active efforts to grow a user base.*

## HTML Validator

The initial run of testing on the W3C html validator displayed a few errors and warning that warranted my attention:

* I had not realised that special characters (the asterix on my forms) needed to be signed off with a semicolon, as missing them renders the HTML invalid. I added these in to remove this error from the validator.

* I had left a space on the mailto: attribute for 'contact us', which was invalid and threw an error. This was amended to remove the error from the validator.

* There was an error on edit review and festival forms as the 'select' options didn't have placeholders as the first child with no 'value' attribute. I hadn't realised this was necessary for the HTML to be valid, but I swiftly added the placeholders in as per the 'add review' and 'add festival' forms.

* I had initially put the heart icon/form to favourite a festival as a direct child of the *h1* element on view_festival.html which was deemed invalid by the validator. I removed it from the *h1* and placed it beneath, which I actually ended up preferring aesthetically in any case.

## CSS Validator

No errors were found when running style.css through the W3C CSS validator.

## JS Validator

Using JSHint, I found that there were no critical errors in my written code. There were a few warnings displayed to do with a few missing or unnecessary semicolons, which were promptly rectified. I had also forgotten the keyword *let* for some of my *for of* statements, which I attribute to my recent introduction to Python and its lack of keywords in for loops.

## PEP8 Compliance

No errors were found when running my Python code through the PEP8 online service. There remained one warning on the GitPod linter about over indention which was only brought about by shortening the line. The function worked exactly as intended and as no errors were thrown by PEP8 online, I deemed this ok to leave.

## Accessibility Testing

Using the WAVE Accessibility Evaluation Tool, I found the following errors and warnings worthy of attention:

* An error was highlighted by the lack of a form *label* element on my search bar, which I subsequently added as with a screen reader only class.

*Contrast errors*
* There was a supposed contrast error for the green CTA button on my home page and in various other locations when directing users towards the Browse page. I darkened the green to white ratio as much as I could without greatly impacting on the intended aesthetic, but unfortunately was still being thrown the error. I have decided to leave the contrast in the current state, with genuine intention to rethink the design on future iterations to ensure it be as accessible as possible. 

* There was also a contrast error from the 'contact us' *call to action* on browse all between the blue and white, which I again darkened as much as possible. As with the previous contrast error, it still appeared despite my efforts, and I will be rethinking the styling of this button on V2 of the site.

* There were three contrast errors on the festival hubs information section, from the external ticket links and the covid 2021 status for when a festival is 'cancelled' or 'going ahead'. The external links were amended in a way that kept the intended aesthetic and cleared the error, however I decided to disregard the contrast issue for the covid 2021 status as it presented the same issues found when amended the previous two bullet points.

* I was presented with a warning about a redundant about a potential redundant link as my footer and main navigation contained the same logo and *anchor* tag to the homepage. I decided to disregard this warning as I deem the footer as being as appropriate a place as the navigation bar to contain a logo and a link back to the homepage.

## Google Lighthouse

Using Google's lighthouse feature, I was able to assess the performance of the site. All pages were working to a good standard, however issues with image size were highlighted. I compressed these using TinyJPG to help improve speed a bit. This was not possible for the images being rendered by URL link, but on future iterations of the site I'd like to use direct upload for these images which will help significantly.

The overall performance of the site (especially on mobile) has plenty of room for improvement on future iterations of the site, as dependency on Bootstrap among other things won't have helped with the speed.

## Notes pasted from README document

#### Bugs

Stripe: typos in my webhook handlers caused 500 errors
Navbar: profile button dropdown stopped working (was because navbar-links had overflow set to hidden)
500 server error when removing items from wishlist (had same class name as basket which meant an undefined variable was in the url)
Product builder resizing issues
Save for later button on product details page was sending items into basket instead of wishlist - buttons were both in the same form
Sort/filter clash - 500 error when sorting to a filtered selection, fixed by clearing the search paramaters in js so that it just sorts from all available products
Delivery cost: missing / 100 in logic which meant my delivery was being multiplied by 5 instead of adding 5%

unsolved bugs:

duplicate orders in profile page

HTML validator:
* stray closing div tag in the basket html page
* clashing id and 'aria-labeledby' on navbar dropdown (unsolved as it breaks the site to remove it)
* buttons were children of a tags
* Form and div closing were overlapping on product detail
* closing h3 tag was still an h1 on the create account page

CSS validator:
* no errors

JS Hint
* semicolons and missing 'let' in for of loops

Pep 8
used the command python3 -m flake8 to get a full list of problems, disregarded migrations, and went through each file to make lines shorter. A few exceptions but mostly compliant.
Pep 8 validator
One error on webhooks.py about indentation, changing it causes the code to fail
Errors shown for long lines in settings but they cannot be shortened so are left

Lighthouse
* No major perforamce issues - compressed all images across the site to help (espeically for the all products page which has more content to load)

Wave - not major accessibility errors or color contrasting errors.
